:::{#about-me}

I am a postgraduate research student at the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/epsrc-cdt-in-data-science/), part of the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the University of Edinburgh.

I am interested in Bayesian approaches to machine learning and statistical inference.
For my PhD I am working on using Bayesian inference and deep learning for scientific applications that have traditionally presented challenges for probabilistic modelling, as part of [Iain Murray](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/)'s research group.
Applications I have worked on include physiological modelling and density estimation for noisy astronomical datasets.

Before moving to Edinburgh I worked as a data scientist and software engineer in London.
For my undergraduate degree I studied engineering at the University of Cambridge.

## Talks

* **Counting Coffee Cups and Photons**  
  A remote talk I gave at the [ANC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/anc) workshop introducing some preliminary work on the problem of inferring photon counts and energies from CCD sensors used in astronomy.  
  \[[Slides](/slides/pileup_talk.pdf)\]

* **Density Estimation with Noisy Data**  
  An introduction and background to our work on Scalable Extreme Deconvolution, plus some thoughts on next steps.  
  \[[Slides](/slides/deconv_talk.pdf)\]

* **Cside 2018**  
  We won one of the categories in the Cside 2018 competition, inferring the parameters of an ordinary differential equation model of the cardiac action potential.
  I gave a talk about our solution at the associated conference.
