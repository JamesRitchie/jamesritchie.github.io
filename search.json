I was a postgraduate research student at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Data Science, part of the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.\nI am interested in Bayesian approaches to machine learning and statistical inference. For my PhD I researched methods for using Bayesian inference and deep learning for scientific applications that have traditionally presented challenges for probabilistic modelling, as part of Iain Murrayâ€™s research group. Applications I have worked on include physiological modelling and density estimation for noisy astronomical datasets.\nBefore moving to Edinburgh I worked as a data scientist and software engineer in London. For my undergraduate degree I studied engineering at the University of Cambridge."
