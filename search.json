For my PhD I am working on using Bayesian inference and deep learning for scientific applications that have traditionally presented challenges for probabilistic modelling, as part of Iain Murrayâ€™s research group. Applications I have worked on include physiological modelling and density estimation for noisy astronomical datasets.\nBefore moving to Edinburgh I worked as a data scientist and software engineer in London. For my undergraduate degree I studied engineering at the University of Cambridge."
